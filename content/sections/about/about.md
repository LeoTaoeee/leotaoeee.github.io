I am a Senior at the University of Michigan studying Math and Computer Science with a minor in history.

I am looking for software Engineering opportunities post-graduation. You can find my portfolio projects in the sections below. Please dont't hesistate to reach out.

During University, I was very curious about Algebraic Combinatorics and I am in the process of trying to publish my first paper on the subject, of which you can find the arXiv pre-print <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16168"><u> here </u></a>.

On campus, I am the internal director for <a href = "https://uac.umich.edu/mac/"><u> Michigan Quizbowl</u></a> and the treasurer for <a href = "https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/animeband"><u> Anime Music Band </u> </a>.

Fun fact, I received a free professional headshot when I ran for university student government, and thats the photo you see on the right.
